  utter_inform_insurance:
  - text: Life insurance (or life assurance, especially in the Commonwealth of Nations)
      is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer,
      where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money (the
      benefit) in exchange for a premium, upon the death of an insured person (often
      the policy holder). Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal
      illness or critical illness can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically
      pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as
      funeral expenses, can also be included in the benefits.
